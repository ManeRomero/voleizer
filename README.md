A simple way to see a concise example about data binding through VueJs Framework. It has been developed in order to help me and my mates to set randomly the matches.

Debt to the job of Carlos V. editting the default database of ISS PRO 6 [PS2], we have a list of 28 Classic Clubs and 35 Classic National squads. These are not available in the original game, as it's said, so when we ran the random tool in the original game, the results was mostly bad, evenmore in the Clubs Mode. This mini app will help us with the teams picking!

The next steps are:

1. Enterelly erase the css styles, and adopt the scss standards.
2. Allow player's name insert through a form.
3. Make the possibility of data local storage or/and cloud storage of that userlist.
4. Finally, allow to save match results.
